========= General description ===========

Here are codes for our two ODE models for DNA limitation.
For model A, we have three different media conditions.
For model B, we only have M9glyCAAT condition.

- The folder 20230329 is running modelA with M9glyCAAT.
- The folder 20230329W is running modelA with M9gly and M9ala.
- The folder 20230523 is running modelB with M9glyCAAT.

The difference between 20230329 and 20230329W is the weighting factors for fitting among six datasets are different. 
For 20230329, we use [1 1 1 1 1 1] (all datasets weighted equally).
For 20230329W, we use [1 2 1 2 1 2] (WT has smaller range and weighted less during the fitting.)

========= Scripts description ===========

1. Import experimental data

This step is to import six different datasets, 
including growth rates, active fractions of RNAPs, ribosomes for both multiN (or WE) and 1N cells.

Run "analyze_experiments_V2.m". 


2. Fitting ODE model to the experimental data

This step we use ODE model (either modelA or model B) to fit the experimental datasets.
The detailed procedure is described in Appendices in the paper. 

To see the parameters used in the model, open the file "load_literatur_param_V4.m" 
under "2R_optimze_all_data" folder. This subscripts contains all parameters used in the ODE.

Run "main_optimize_parameter_repeats.m", 
it will generate a temporal data structure "output_array.mat".


3. Summarize data from ODE model

This step analyze the fitting results. 
Manaully load "output_array.mat" into MATLAB and run "post_processing_repeat_simulation_V3.m".
It will generate a file "data_summaryC.mat". This files includes all data for post-processing.
