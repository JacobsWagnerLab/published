# Particle diffusivity analysis during acute starvation

Authors: Samuel Ho, Alexandros Papagiannakis and Christine Jacobs-Wagner

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook which summarizes the analysis of the Î¼NS particle diffusivity in the *Escherichia coli* cytoplasm during acute carbon starvation. Dr Samuel Ho and Dr Alexandros Papagiannakis generated and analyzed all data. Prof. Christine Jacobs-Wagner supervised the study. 

## The repositoru includes:
1. SamHo_etal_effects_of_carbon_starvation_on_particle_diffusivity.ipynb -> the Jupyter notebook
2. gaussian_statistics.py -> a script that includes all fuctions used to calculate the diffusion statistics (anomalous exponent and non-Gaussian parameter)
3. filtering_good_trajectories.py -> a script used for the classification of the long Gaussian-like particle trajectories
4. data_plotting.py -> a script which includes the plotting functions
