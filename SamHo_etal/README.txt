#Particle diffusivity analysis during acute starvation

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook which summarizes the analysis of the $\mu$NS particle diffusivity in the *Escherichia coli* cytoplasm during acute carbon starvation. Dr Samuel Ho and Dr Alexandros Papagiannakis generated and analyzed all data. Prof. Christine Jacobs-Wagner supervised the study.
