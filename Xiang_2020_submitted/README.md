This repository contains code used in Xiang_et_al_2020, currently submitted for review.

Requirements: For all MATLAB code, [MATLAB 2017b](https://www.mathworks.com/products/new_products/release2017b.html) or above is required. For all Python code, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) with Python 3.6 or above is required. Some code relies on the data structure of cellList obtained from [Oufti](http://oufti.org/).

This repository is organized in the following way:
  - [particle_tracking](./particle_tracking): code used for single particle tracking analysis
  - [simulation](./simulation): code used to simulate polymer conformations
  - [cryo_ET](./cryo_ET): code used to construct density maps for ribosomes localized in cryo-ET
  - [pixel_correlation](./pixel_correlation): code used to calculate the correlation between pixel intensities
  - [demograph](./demograph): code used to construct the demograph plots
